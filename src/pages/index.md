  title: What we do
  description: We apply the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence to help
    users take control of their own health. In today's healthcare marketplace,
    the traditional doctor patient relationship has changed into a more
    transactional one, and people have no choice but to take more control over
    their own health and healthcare needs.
description: The core of our technology is around user self reporting. While
  self reporting of various aspects of health has been done before, through
  smart devices or apps like MyFitnessPal, our technology combines voice
  recognition and natural language processing to make the it much simpler and
  consistent for the user. The user's data is held completely privately, and the
  user has full control over who gets to see the data and who the data is shared
  with.
